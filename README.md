# Vacation Insight(Project One)

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

Hotel API

For the hotels.com API we use a fetch within a fetch to accomplish a search of relevant user inputs. First, the API must be used to acquire the “gaiaID” which specifies the cities geographical region. Second, using that ID, as well as user input data, we can search the hotel API to return the desired results. Additionally, the results will display as a series of cards in the body of the main page.
