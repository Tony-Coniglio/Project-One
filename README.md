# Vacation Insight(Project One)
A one-stop shop to help you plan your next vacation

We aim to utilize simplicity and functionality to help our users save time and energy when planning their next vacation. 

Rather than employing a multi-platform search to choose your destination by researching hotels, climate, cost, and attractions, Vacation Insite will give users as surface level summary of their destination.

## Description

### Hotel API

For the hotels.com API we use a fetch within a fetch to accomplish a search of relevant user inputs. First, the API must be used to acquire the “gaiaID” which specifies the cities geographical region. Second, using that ID, as well as user input data, we can search the hotel API to return the desired results. Additionally, the results will display as a series of cards in the body of the main page.
